## 1. What is Spring Framework?

- Spring is a **lightweight, open‑source Java framework** for building **enterprise‑level applications**
- It provides features such as **Dependency Injection(DI)**, **Inversion of Control(IOC)**, to manage the object cration & lifecycle by framework itself, 
- It also provides  **Aspect-Oriented Programming(AOP)** , declarative **transaction management** , **logging**, **security**, and seamless integration with ORM frameworks like **Hibernate** for efficient database operations.
- Spring offers a rich ecosystem of modules (Spring MVC, Spring JDBC, Spring Data, Spring ORM, and Spring Security ) for end-to-end rapid App development and serves as the foundation for Spring Boot.


### Key Problems Spring Solves
- Tight coupling between classes
- Complex object creation, boilerplate codes
- Reduces repetitive code in JDBC, transactions, and configuration.
- Difficult testing with mocks and dependency injection.
- Spring solves complexity, tight coupling, and boilerplate in enterprise Java applications.

---

## 2. Advantages of Spring

- ♻️ __Lightweight Opensource and modular:__ – you use only what you need, reducing application complexity.
- 🔁 __Loose coupling with Dependency Injection (DI) & Inversion of Control mechanism:__ – improves code maintainability, testing, and flexibility.
- 🧪 __Powerful transaction management:__ – supports declarative transactions across databases and ORM , Messaging , Security and tools like Hibernate.
- ♻️ __AOP support:__ – cleanly handles cross-cutting concerns such as logging, security, and auditing.
- 🔌 __Easy integration:__ – works seamlessly with Hibernate, JPA, JDBC, REST, messaging, and other frameworks.
- 🔁 __Spring Boot support:__ – enables **Rapid** end-to-end App development development with minimal configuration.
- 🧪 __Easy unit & integration testing:__  Mocking object supported with dependency injection
- ♻️ __Strong community and ecosystem:__  excellent documentation, tools, and long-term support.

---

## 3. Inversion of Control (IoC)

- Inversion of Control (IoC) is a design principle , where Spring container takes control of object creation and dependency management instead of the application code.
- That is  👉 Instead of the developer creating objects using **new** operator, Spring creates, manages, and injects them. 
- Developer does **not use `new` keyword** directly
- Spring container manages object lifecycle, object creation and dependency management is transferred from the program to the Spring container.

### Traditional Approach (Without IoC)

```java
Engine engine = new PetrolEngine();
Car car = new Car(engine);

// Developer controls object creation
// Tight coupling between classes
```

### With Spring IoC
```java
@Component
class PetrolEngine implements Engine {}

@Component
class Car {
    @Autowired
    Engine engine;
}

// Spring container creates objects
// Spring manages dependencies automatically
```
### IoC Containers

- **BeanFactory** – basic container
- **ApplicationContext** – advanced (recommended)

---

## 4. Dependency Injection (DI)

- Dependency Injection is a design principle where objects do not create their own dependencies.
- Instead, Spring container injects the required objects at runtime.
- 👉 This promotes loose coupling, easy testing, and better maintainability.

### Types of Dependency Injection 

- Constructor Injection ✅ (Best practice)
- Setter Injection
- Field Injection (Not recommended for testing)


### Problem without Dependency Injection (Tight Coupling)

### Example – Constructor Injection

```java
class Engine {
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Engine started");
    }
}

class Car {
    private Engine engine = new Engine(); // tightly coupled

    public void drive() {
        engine.start();
        System.out.println("Car is running");
    }
}

```
❌ Problems:

- Car is tightly coupled to Engine
- Difficult to replace Engine or test Car

### How Dependency Injection (Loose Coupling) solve it ?

### Step 1: Create Interface
```java
public interface Engine {
    void start();
}
```
### Step 2: Implement Interface
```java
@Component
public class PetrolEngine implements Engine {
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Petrol Engine started");
    }
}
```
### Step 3: Inject Dependency using Constructor Injection (Recommended)
```java
@Component
public class Car {

    private final Engine engine;

    @Autowired
    public Car(Engine engine) {
        this.engine = engine;
    }

    public void drive() {
        engine.start();
        System.out.println("Car is running");
    }
}
```
### Advantages of DI

- Loose coupling between classes
- Easy unit testing (mock dependencies)
- Better code maintainability
- Easy to switch implementations

### Difference between IoC and DI ?
 
-  **IoC says who creates objects, DI says how they are provided.**
-  IoC is a principle where Spring controls object creation, and DI is the technique Spring uses to inject dependencies into those objects.
  <img width="1581" height="623" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/46ad7fd5-ea45-48a3-9673-30688e4d475a" />

---
## What are Spring Beans ? 
- A Spring Bean is a **Java object** - whose entire lifecycle (create → configure → inject → destroy) is managed by the Spring Framework IoC container.
- Beans are created based on configuration metadata (XML, annotations, or Java config)

### [1] Using XML (legacy)
```xml
<bean id="userService" class="com.example.UserService"/>
```
### [2] Using Annotations (most common)
```java
@Component
public class UserService {
}
```
### [3] Using Java Configuration
```java
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {

    @Bean
    public UserService userService() {
        return new UserService();
    }
}
```

- Beans support Dependency Injection (DI)
- They promote loose coupling and easy testing

---

## What are the types of Spring Bean scopes?
- `Bean Scope` defines `how many instances` of a Spring Bean are created and `how long` they live within the Spring container.

### Types of Bean Scopes

- `singleton` (default) – one instance per Spring container
- `prototype` – new instance every time it’s requested
- `request` – one instance per HTTP request
- `session` – one instance per HTTP session
- `application` – one instance per ServletContext
- `websocket` – one instance per WebSocket session

### prototype: type Bean scopes – new instance every time it’s requested
```java

@Component
@Scope("prototype")
public class PaymentService {
}

@Autowired
PaymentService p1;

@Autowired
PaymentService p2;

// A new instance is created EVERY time PaymentService is requested
// p1 → one PaymentService object
// p2 → another PaymentService object
// p1 != p2  ( Both are different objects as Bean scope creation type: prototype)

 
// The lifecycle lasts only until the client code releases the reference, i.e- Until the client code is done with it
// Spring IOC container manages it only up to dependency injection. After that, the bean’s lifecycle is managed by the client, not Spring.
```
### Singleton Bean scope - only one isntance allowed
```java
@Component
public class OrderService {

    @Autowired
    private PaymentService p1;

    @Autowired
    private PaymentService p2;

    // Here both P1 and P2 are same objects as Bean scope creation type: singleton by default - only one isntance allowed
}
```
### Request scope
- Request scope creates a single bean instance per one HTTP request, shared within that request and destroyed once the request completes.

```java

@Component
@RequestScope
public class PaymentService {
}


@RestController
public class OrderController {

    @Autowired
    private PaymentService p1;

    @Autowired
    private PaymentService p2;

    @GetMapping("/pay")
    public String pay() {
        return String.valueOf(p1 == p2);  //true  ✔ Same request → same bean instance
    }
}
```
- Same HTTP request → same PaymentService instance
- Different HTTP request → new instance
- Previous Bean instance is → destroyed after request completion


### Importance of Bean Scope

- Controls object creation and memory usage
- Helps manage stateful vs stateless beans
- Improves performance and scalability
- Prevents thread-safety issues

---
### Bean Lifecycle (1-liner)

- __Instantiate → Populate properties → Initialize → Ready → Destroy__

---

## What is Spring Container?

- The **Spring Container** is responsible for **creating, configuring, and managing the lifecycle** of **Spring Beans and injecting dependencies**.
- `Spring Container` = `Bean Factory` + `Dependency Injection` + `Lifecycle Management`


<img width="1658" height="660" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ede6c3bd-8bf4-4b70-b326-d25c409dcec6" />

### Responsibilities of Spring Container

- Creates Spring Beans
- Injects dependencies (DI)
- Manages bean lifecycle
- Handles bean scopes (singleton, prototype, request, etc.)
- Manages configuration metadata

### Types of Spring Containers

- `BeanFactory` – basic container (lazy initialization)
- `ApplicationContext` – advanced container (most commonly used)

### BeanFactory (Basic Spring Container)
- `BeanFactory` is a basic `Spring container` that uses `lazy initialization` and creates `beans/bean objects` only when they are requested.

__Key Characteristics:__

- Basic IoC container
- Supports Dependency Injection
- Uses lazy initialization (beans are created only when requested)
- Lightweight and memory-efficient
- No advanced enterprise features by default
  
__Lazy Initialization Explained:__

- Beans are NOT created at application startup
- A bean is created only when getBean() is called

```java
// Beans
public class PaymentService {
    public PaymentService() {
        System.out.println("PaymentService created");
    }
}

BeanFactory factory = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("beans.xml");
PaymentService service = factory.getBean(PaymentService.class);  // PaymentService created
```


### Example using ApplicationContext:
- `ApplicationContext` is an advanced Spring container that extend BeanFactory , It support creates, configures, and manages Spring beans.
- It provides dependency injection, lifecycle management, and enterprise features like `AOP`, `events`, and `internationalization`.
- By default, it eagerly initializes singleton beans at application startup.
- `ApplicationContext` is almost always preferred/recommanded over `BeanFactory`

```java
//Bean => Creates PaymentService

@Component
public class PaymentService {
    public String pay() {
        return "Payment Successful";
    }
}

// Controller / Client => Creates OrderController

@RestController
public class OrderController {

    @Autowired
    private PaymentService paymentService;

    @GetMapping("/pay")
    public String pay() {
        return paymentService.pay();  // Injects PaymentService into OrderController
    }
}

// Manages their ( PaymentService & OrderController) lifecycle
```

---

##  Difference between `BeanFactory` and `ApplicationContext`?

### Spring offers two main container abstractions:
    - 1. BeanFactory
    - 2. ApplicationContext
- These are interfaces, not concrete classes and they represent two different levels of container capability.
- Below is the hierarchy of the BeanFactory(I) and ApplicationContext(I) with some of their implementation classes.

<img width="800" height="324" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae89dd05-299f-499a-a4bb-489ded964aec" />

### BeanFactory :
- BeanFactory, defined in `org.springframework.beans.factory`, - is the `basic/root IoC container interface` in Spring.
- `XmlBeanFactory` implements `BeanFactory` (deprecated)
- It provides core functionalities such as bean creation and dependency injection.

__Key Characteristics:__
- Beans are created only when requested (on demand)
- This behavior is known as lazy initialization
- Suitable for lightweight or memory-constrained applications But Rarely used in  Real-world-Apps , mostly theoretical.

### ApplicationContext:
- `ApplicationContext`, defined in `org.springframework.context`, -- is an `Advanced container interface` that `extends BeanFactory` and provides additional `enterprise-level features`.
- `ClassPathXmlApplicationContext`, `FileSystemXmlApplicationContext`, etc, `implement ApplicationContext`
  
__Key Features:__

- Eager initialization (at startup, by default)
- Annotation-based configuration
- Advance feature like `Event` handling ,`Internationalization (i18n)`, `AOP` etc fully supported which are used in most Real-world-Apps

## What are the types of Dependency Injections in java spring ?
- Spring supports the 3 types of Dependency Injection
  
```
1. Constructor Injection ( Recommended ✅ )
2. Setter Injection
3. Field Injection (Not Recommended ❌)
```

###  `Constructor Injection ` => Dependencies are provided through the constructor.
```java
@Component
public class OrderService {

    private final PaymentService paymentService;

    @Autowired
    public OrderService(PaymentService paymentService) {
        this.paymentService = paymentService;   // Makes dependencies mandatory , Avoids NullPointerException
    }
}
```
### `Setter Injection` ( Recommended ✅ ) => Dependencies are injected using setter methods.

```java
@Component
public class OrderService {

    private PaymentService paymentService;

    @Autowired
    public void setPaymentService(PaymentService paymentService) {
        this.paymentService = paymentService;
    }

// Optional dependencies - Runtime reconfiguration via set Method
}
```
### `Field Injection`  (Not Recommended ❌) = > Dependencies are injected directly into fields. 

```java
@Component
public class OrderService {

    @Autowired
    private PaymentService paymentService;
}


// Hidden dependencies
// Breaks immutability
```
## Why is constructor injection preferred?
- 👉 Because it ensures mandatory dependencies, promotes immutability, and improves testability.

#############################################################################################################################
Allows correct behavior in web applications
---

```
### Bean Scopes

- `singleton` (default)
- `prototype`
- `request`
- `session`

```java
@Component
@Scope("prototype")
class UserService {}
```

---

## 6. Bean Life Cycle

### Bean Life Cycle Phases

1. Bean Instantiation
2. Dependency Injection
3. Initialization
4. Ready for use
5. Destruction

### Life Cycle Annotations

```java
@PostConstruct
public void init() {
    System.out.println("Bean initialized");
}

@PreDestroy
public void destroy() {
    System.out.println("Bean destroyed");
}
```

---

## 7. Spring Annotations (Very Important ⭐)

### Stereotype Annotations

- `@Component` – generic
- `@Service` – business logic
- `@Repository` – DAO layer
- `@Controller` – MVC controller
- `@RestController` – REST APIs

### Dependency Injection

- `@Autowired`
- `@Qualifier`
- `@Primary`

---

## 8. What is Spring Boot?

- Built on top of Spring Framework
- Eliminates XML configuration
- Provides **auto‑configuration**
- Comes with **embedded servers** (Tomcat)

### Benefits of Spring Boot

- Faster development
- Production‑ready features
- Minimal configuration

---

## 9. Spring Boot Application Structure

```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class DemoApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(DemoApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

### `@SpringBootApplication` Includes

- `@Configuration`
- `@EnableAutoConfiguration`
- `@ComponentScan`

---

## 10. REST Controller

- Used to build RESTful web services
- Returns JSON/XML response

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api")
public class HelloController {

    @GetMapping("/hello")
    public String hello() {
        return "Hello Spring";
    }
}
```

---

## 11. MVC vs REST

| MVC | REST |
|---|---|
| Returns View (HTML) | Returns Data (JSON) |
| `@Controller` | `@RestController` |
| Used for UI apps | Used for APIs |

---

## 12. application.properties

- Used for configuration
- Environment‑specific values

```properties
server.port=8081
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/test
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=root
```

---

## 13. JPA & Hibernate

- Hibernate is an ORM framework
- JPA is a specification

### Entity Example

```java
@Entity
@Table(name = "users")
public class User {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    private String name;
}
```

### Repository

```java
public interface UserRepository extends JpaRepository<User, Long> {}
```
