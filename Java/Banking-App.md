# Full-Stack FinTech Banking Platform | Spring Boot, React, Azure & CI/CD:

- Designed and developed a secure, production-ready FinTech banking platform using Java
Spring Boot and React (SPA), providing end-to-end account management and core banking
operations.
- The system supports account creation and management, deposit, withdrawal, fund transfer,
and transaction history tracking, with enterprise-grade security, auditing, exception
handling, and cloud deployment on Microsoft Azure using automated CI/CD pipelines.
- Developed RESTful banking APIs using Java, Spring Boot, and Spring MVC for account
management, deposit, withdrawal, and inter-account fund transfers with transactional
integrity.
- Implemented Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) for centralized exception handling,
defining custom error models, error codes (e.g., ACCOUNT_NOT_FOUND), and standardized
API error responses; enforced field-level validation using @Valid and custom validators to
prevent
- Designed secure authentication and authorization using Spring Security and JWT,
implementing role-based access for Customers and Auditors.
- Built a scalable backend architecture using the Controller–Service–Repository pattern,
DTOs, and best practices for exception handling and validation.
- Designed and optimized MySQL / PostgreSQL databases, ensuring data consistency, proper
indexing, and complete transaction history management.
- Implemented transaction logging and audit trails for all DEPOSIT, WITHDRAW, and TRANSFER operations to meet FinTech compliance requirements.
- Developed a React Single-Page Application (SPA) with secure login, account onboarding,
profile management, transaction history views, fund transfers, and auditor dashboards.
- Integrated React frontend with secured Spring Boot APIs using JWT tokens, CORS
configuration, and secure REST communication.
- Integrated SMTP email notifications for account creation, password reset, and transaction
alerts.
- Implemented Spring Boot Actuator for application monitoring, exposing web and JMX
endpoints to track health, metrics, and application performance in production.
- Containerized applications using Docker and Docker Compose, deployed backend services
on Azure Virtual Machines, and integrated Azure Blob Storage for secure file handling.
- Implemented testing with JUnit, Mockito, WireMock, performance optimization using Redis
caching, and - - Automatic API documentation with Swagger (OpenAPI) for Spring Boot
banking services.
- Designed and maintained CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions, enabling automated
testing, Docker image builds, zero-downtime deployments, and monitoring with Prometheus,
Grafana, and Playwright.
