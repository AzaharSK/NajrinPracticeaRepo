## What are reserved words ? How many reserved words in java ?

Reserved words (also called keywords) are words that have a special predefined meaning in Java.

You `cannot use` them as identifier:

- Variable names
- Class names
- Method names
- Interface names
- Package names

Because the `Java compiler` already understands them `as part of the java language syntax`.


### Java has 52 reserved words (keywords).

```java

abstract     assert       boolean      break        byte
case         catch        char         class        const*
continue     default      do           double       else
enum         extends      final        finally      float
for          goto*        if           implements   import
instanceof   int          interface    long         native
new          package      private      protected    public
return       short        static       strictfp     super
switch       synchronized this         throw        throws
transient    try          void         volatile     while
const        goto
