# Unified Modeling Language (UML) Diagrams
`Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a general-purpose modeling language.`
- The main aim of UML is to define a standard way to visualize the way a system and documenting Software Detail Architeture Design has been designed. 
- It is quite similar to blueprints used in other fields of engineering. UML is not a programming language, it is rather a visual language.

- We use UML diagrams to show the behavior and structure of a system.
- UML helps software engineers, businessmen, and system architects with modeling, design, and analysis.

__Need of UML:__

- Provides a clear visual communication language for collaboration across multiple teams in complex projects.
- Helps non-technical stakeholders (business users, managers) understand system requirements and functionality without reading code.
- Saves development time by allowing teams to visualize workflows, interactions, and system structure early.
- Essential for large-scale systems where tracking thousands of classes and objects becomes difficult.
- Enables early detection of design problems like high coupling, excessive dependencies, and circular references.
- Supports major methodologies like Agile and Waterfall by enabling iterative and incremental system design.
- Works for many domains — e.g., banking, inventory, enterprise, and web applications.
- Improves team collaboration by giving everyone a common modeling language independent of programming language.
- Helps teams understand the complete system architecture and functionality, reducing future errors.
- UML diagrams are categorized into Structural diagrams (system components) and Behavioral diagrams (system behavior & interactions).


## Types of UML Diagrams
- UML is linked with object-oriented design and analysis. UML makes use of elements and forms associations between them to form diagrams. Diagrams in UML can be broadly classified as:-
     
     - 1. Structural Modeling
     - 2. Behavioral Modeling

### Structural Modeling
Structural modeling captures the static features of a system. They consist of the following −
```
Classes diagrams
Objects diagrams
Deployment diagrams
Package diagrams
Composite structure diagram
Component diagram
```
- Structural model represents the framework for the system and this framework is the place where all other components exist.
- Hence, the class diagram, component diagram and deployment diagrams are part of structural modeling. They all represent the elements and the mechanism to assemble them.
- The structural model never describes the dynamic or Run-TIME behavior of the system. Class diagram is the most widely used structural diagram.

### Behavioral Modeling
Behavioral model describes the interaction in the system. It represents the interaction among the structural diagrams. Behavioral modeling shows the dynamic nature of the system. They consist of the following −

```
Activity diagrams
Interaction diagrams
Use case diagrams
```
All the above show the dynamic sequence of flow in a system.
